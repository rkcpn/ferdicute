# Ferdicute

Minimalist app for organizing your favorite web apps, inspired by Ferdium/Ferdi/Franz.
Based on Qt framework with focus on speed and minimal resource requirements

## Why Ferdicute?

Ferdium is an electron app which is known to take a lot of resources, especially high CPU usage.
In contrast, Ferdicute is a native app that can be compiled for any platform and therefore ensures minimal resource usage.
